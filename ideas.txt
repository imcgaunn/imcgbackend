the backend piece of my website is primarily to support
the blog part. I want the client to be a read-only view of
a set of posts in s3.

It would be cool if the backend could be an index into an
s3 bucket. It would keep track of all the blog posts and when
the frontend asks it, it can fetch the post sources from s3
and render some html or hiccup that the frontend can use.

the backend can make sure that the generated html doesn't
contain anything questionable...but it is very likely that the
html is safe, because the sources are all written by me. why
would I play myself?
