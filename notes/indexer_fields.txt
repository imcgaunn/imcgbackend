indexer fields
==

the blog post indexer will open posts in s3 and
peek at some metadata at the beginning of each post.

there are only a few supported keywords, i'd like to
keep this basic.

also, for now, all of these keywords will stay in the body of
the post that appears on the website. that is good incentive to
avoid getting crazy with these; the users will see it.
as long as keywords are also relevant information to users,
this should be fine.

keywords
==
title: -> the title the post should have on the blog.
tags: -> optional tags that should be included in the
        post's index entry. this is nice for quickly
        retrieving slices of blog posts based on mysterious criteria.
